      <p>Glacier National Park is gorgeous to visit in August. The sun was shining
      in the park and the flora and fauna were in abundance. The snow had melted
      and made way for beautiful lakes, streams and creeks. Hiking trails were busy
      and red buses were touring throughout the park. Traveling across Going to the
      Sun Road was adventurous and beautiful.</p>

      <p>At the very end of the road from the Many Glacier Entrance of Glacier
      National Park sits the trail to Redrock Ralls. This trail greets one by high
      and thick brush along the immediate sides of the trail and thus camouflaging
      the many creatures that abound. Bears and cubs swim across the lake, be sure
      to wear your bells and announce your presence if dinner you do not want to make!</p>

      <p>Along the Hidden Lake trail at Logan Pass there are many different critters
      and creatures to be found. From tailless squirrels, to marmots, prairie dogs to
      mountain goats, everyone one looks something furry can be seen! And although
      it may be August and the sun is shining bright, heavy packed snow can still be
      found, so on the trail one must stay bound.</p>
