The Iron Yard Academy (Charleston, SC) Front End Engineering Day 2 Basic Website w/ Multiple Layouts

Built basic website that has an external style sheet and links to three pages on Jan 6.

Jan 7 made multiple layouts, a different layout for each page from specific layout options given in class.

Jan 13 made site responsive and used SASS instead of standard CSS. Responsive is not perfect, but sizes pretty nicely for different screen sizes.
